# SPA Example
**SPA - Single Page Application**
This SPA example has been created to demonstrate what a SPA looks like and how
it is programmed. This example does not include or talk about routing.

**This application does NOT take care of error handling propering.** This example is only intended to show how a very very basic single page application can be implemented. Do not use this example to understand JS concepts other than single page application.
